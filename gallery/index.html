    This example requires just 5 lines of new code (and editing a few lines of
    auto-generated code). Follow along and, in just a few moments, you can use this 
    blab as a template for your own work.

    <img src='//spacemath.github.io/resources/images/thumbs/mars2.png'>
    </a>
    <p>
    Mars is actually a very simple body. It is round, it spins, and it has mass.
    Although we can't visit the interior of Mars, or any other planet for that matter,
    there are ways that we can explore a planet's interior just by knowing 
    a few basic things about it as a planet.
    In this lab, you will create a model of the interior of Mars by knowing three
    basic things about its bulk properties.

    </a>
    <p>
    Although we can never visit the interior of a far-off planet, we can use the observed mass and radius of the planet, 
    plus some assumptions about what is inside (rock, water, ice, gas, etc) to create a plausible model of the interior of the planet.

    <img src='img/solitons.png'>
    </a>
    <p>
    Geordi La Forge was right: solitons <i>are</i> exciting&mdash;no matter 
    what his colleagues may think.
    
    A soliton is a pulse that experiences both nonlinearity and
    dispersion. Nonlinearity 
    sharpens the pulse&mdash;taller parts travel faster than shorter parts 
    (like a wave breaking on a beach). Dispersion spreads it out&mdash;different 
    frequencies travel at different speeds. With a soliton the sharpening and 
    spreading balance <i>exactly</i> (and the balance is stable!).
