This is a Blab (Web Laboratory)
===============================

A blab is a pithy, crisp &mdash; above all, *easy* &mdash; way to do scientific computation
in the browser. 

The example below requires just 5 lines of new code (and editing a few lines of
auto-generated code). Follow along and, in just a few moments, you can use this 
blab as a template for your own work. Let's start with some math:

$$z(\theta;k)=x+iy=\exp(it)-\frac{1}{2}\exp(ikt)+\frac{1}{3}\exp(-i14t)$$

The parameter $k$ is set by the slider, and the plot shows the real and imaginary
parts of $z$ as $t$ is swept. The table shows powers of $k$.

`pos:1, order: 3`

Code to control the layout is auto-generated. You can show, then edit, 
this code by clicking the slider (label), plot, or table.  Or click on the text
to edit it (the source is GitHub Flavored Markdown).

To create your own blab, edit any code and click the "Save" button that appears
in the upper right. Blabs are saved to GitHub gists. You can save anonymously 
(but each time you save you'll get a new gist ID), or to your GitHub account 
(using a token).

Documentation and examples can be found here.
